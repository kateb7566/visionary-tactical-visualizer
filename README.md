# ⚽ Tactical Visualizer

**Tactical Visualizer** is a Python-based tool designed to help beginner coaches, specialists, football enthusiasts, and content creators visualize and analyze fundamental game situations. This project lays the foundation for a robust, interactive tactical analysis system with support for advanced visual features and data handling.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Visualize team formations in different phases: in-possession, out-of-possession, transitions.
* Create clear diagrams showing:

  * Player active areas.
  * Passing lanes.
  * Tactical zones and pitch partitioning.
* Enable static frame analysis using annotated diagrams and tactical overlays.
* Support import/export of tactical data in light formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
